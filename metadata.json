    "long_description": "= DESCRIPTION:\n\nThe block_device cookbook manages a block_device that not only can be mounted\nbut also has the ability to backup/restore itself to persistent storage of the\ncloud in which it is running. The block_device also has the capability to \nbackup/restore to/from remote clouds such as Rackspace's CloudFiles and \nAmazon's S3.\n\nFor premium account customers, this cookbook will be overridden by the full \nblock_device implementation.  This cookbook is included as a placeholder to \nmeet the block_device dependancy requirement for public RightScale cookbooks \nand ServerTemplates. \n\n",
